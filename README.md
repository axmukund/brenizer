# Bokeh Mosaic Stitcher - Starter Repo

This scaffold contains the project structure and the full implementation spec for a single-page, client-side Brenizer-style panorama stitcher optimized for GitHub Pages.

Files included:
- SPEC.md : Full integrated spec (condensed/scaffolded)
- README.md : This file
- package.json : minimal script hooks
- vite.config.ts : base path handling
- src/ : starter TypeScript files and placeholders
- public/ : placeholder directories for WASM, models, shaders, and classic workers

Next steps:
1. Open this folder in VSCode.
2. Run `npm install` to add dependencies (you'll need vite, typescript, onnxruntime-web, etc).
3. Start implementing phases from the spec (see SPEC.md Sections 12 and 13 for the work plan).
